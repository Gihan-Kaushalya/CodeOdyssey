            <p>&nbsp;
                In the late 19th century, under the guidance of Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera, a new chapter began for
                Buddhist education in Sri Lanka. On a historic day, November 1, 1886, the Buddhist Theosophical Society
                inaugurated an English-Buddhist school at 19 Prince Street, Pettah. This humble beginning saw just 37
                eager
                students, but it was the spark that would ignite a legacy.

                As the school grew, it moved to 61 Maliban Street in 1888, accommodating 130 boys. The visionary C. W.
                Leadbeater became its first principal, laying the foundation for what would become Ananda College. By
                March
                1889, the school was officially registered, boasting 120 students, with J. P. R. Weerasuriya becoming
                the
                first student to pass the prestigious Cambridge junior examination. That same year, A. E. Bultjens, a
                Cambridge graduate and devout Buddhist, took over as principal.

                The school faced challenges, including a controversy due to its proximity to a Catholic school,
                prompting
                another move to 54 Maliban Street in 1890. However, this move only fueled its growth, with student
                numbers
                rising to 200 by 1892 and 270 by 1894. The generous donation of 3.2 acres of land by Mr. Tudor
                Rajapaksha
                led to the school's relocation to Maradana, where, on August 17, 1895, it was proudly renamed Ananda
                College
                Colombo. R. A. Mirando served as its manager until his passing during the 1915 riots.

                Under the leadership of Patrick de Silva Kularatne in 1918, the school's enrollment skyrocketed from 450
                to
                1,000 students within two years. With a growing budget and an expanding student body, Ananda College
                continued to flourish. By 1961, it had officially transitioned into a government school, securing its
                place
                as a cornerstone of education in Sri Lanka.
